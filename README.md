#### DH150-WESLEYC
Week 2 Discussion
The following analyzes th hueristics of two sites for middle-aged women. 
Through this evaluation of hueristics, it is possible to create a site that is more easily navigable for the in-user and their desires when viewing the webpage. 

### Website 1 : Bustle. com
https://www.bustle.com/


## Match between system and the real world

- Bustle assumes that all users see the "Rule Breakers" in society as bad-ass women in politics. That is not necessarily true. Instead the experts at bustle should be more straight-forward and say "politics". Maybe gear toward voting and the upcoming election. 

## User control and freedom

- There is freedom on Bustle's site. But there is such a thing as too much freedom, to the point where the site becomes difficult to navigate. If the user does not have a sort of structure, the user can get caught up in the excess and become lost.

## Consistency and standards

- When looking at the Bustle page and going into the menu, on the left side of the page are various topics, such as: Entertainment, Style, Wellness, Life, Rule Breakers, and Experiences. This seems to be a poor User interface, becuase some of these categories do not have universal approaches. They imply that "Life" for one user may look the same for another or "Rule Breakers" seems ambiguous. 

## Flexibility and efficiency of use

![Bustle Flexibility 4](https://github.com/wesleybleu/DH150-WESLEYC/blob/main/flex_04.png)

- The user has to keep going back to menu to navigate the site. There is not a flexible way to get around the site. Once the user leaves a page, the user may get lost and can no longer return to a page. The site kind of has an overload of information. There are many stories that the user can view under each category, it is almost infinte, this can be confusing and visually exhausting for the user. 

## Aesthetic and minimalist design

When landing on the Bustle site, the user is hit with an overload of information. There are many stories. Clearly some are highlighted. Others are left in small text. This is not a minimalist Design. It pulls attention to many places. The site also is not cohesive as the user scrolls down. Specifically, the homepage has variations in the interface- it may be helpful to simplify it.
