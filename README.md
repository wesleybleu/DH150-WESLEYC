#### DH250-WESLEYC
Week 2 Discussion
The following analyzes th hueristics of two sites for middle-aged women. 
Through this evaluation of hueristics, it is possible to create a site that is more easily navigable for the in-user and their desires when viewing the webpage. 

Tentative title:  (of interest) of your project
Wesley Cox| DH 250: USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN 
Description: I want to create a lifestyle and possibly a media webpage that focuses on the lives of African Americans- specifically African American women. I plan to create something culturally relevant, easy to navigate, and maybe a bit educational.

###### Website 1 : Bustle. com
https://www.bustle.com/
Bustle is a site aimed at middle-aged women specifically in catgories of entertainment, lifestyle, health, and more. 

## 1: Visibility of System Status

- I did not particularly see an issue with the system status. This is a site for lifestlye and latest news.

## 2: Match between system and the real world

![Bustle Rule Breakers](https://github.com/wesleybleu/DH150-WESLEYC/blob/main/bustle-rulebreakers.png)

- Bustle assumes that all users see the "Rule Breakers" in society as bad-ass women in politics. That is not necessarily true. Instead the experts at bustle should be more straight-forward and say "politics". Maybe gear toward voting and the upcoming election. 

## 3:User control and freedom

- There is freedom on Bustle's site. But there is such a thing as too much freedom, to the point where the site becomes difficult to navigate. If the user does not have a sort of structure, the user can get caught up in the excess and become lost.

## 4:Consistency and standards

![Bustle Menu](https://github.com/wesleybleu/DH150-WESLEYC/blob/main/Bustle_systemandrealworld.png)

- When looking at the Bustle page and going into the menu, on the left side of the page are various topics, such as: Entertainment, Style, Wellness, Life, Rule Breakers, and Experiences. This seems to be a poor User interface, becuase some of these categories do not have universal approaches. They imply that "Life" for one user may look the same for another or "Rule Breakers" seems ambiguous. 

## 5:Error Prevention

- There was no analysis of error prevention. This feature would not be of use for this kind of website.

## 6:Recognition rather than recall

-This site has the menu button easily located. However- can it be analyzed as recognition rather than recall feature? I guess so, this feature is observable and helps the user to escape.

## 7:Flexibility and efficiency of use

![Bustle Flexibility 1](https://github.com/wesleybleu/DH150-WESLEYC/blob/main/flex_01.png) 
![Bustle Flexibility 2](https://github.com/wesleybleu/DH150-WESLEYC/blob/main/flex_02.png)
![Bustle Flexibility 3](https://github.com/wesleybleu/DH150-WESLEYC/blob/main/flex_03.png)
![Bustle Flexibility 4](https://github.com/wesleybleu/DH150-WESLEYC/blob/main/flex_04.png)

- The user has to keep going back to menu to navigate the site. There is not a flexible way to get around the site. Once the user leaves a page, the user may get lost and can no longer return to a page. The site kind of has an overload of information. There are many stories that the user can view under each category, it is almost infinte, this can be confusing and visually exhausting for the user. 

## 8:Aesthetic and minimalist design

![Bustle Aesthetic and Minimalist Design 4](https://github.com/wesleybleu/DH150-WESLEYC/blob/main/a%26m04.png)

When landing on the Bustle site, the user is hit with an overload of information. There are many stories. Clearly some are highlighted. Others are left in small text. This is not a minimalist Design. It pulls attention to many places. The site also is not cohesive as the user scrolls down. Specifically, the homepage has variations in the interface- it may be helpful to simplify it.

## 9: Help users recognize, disagnose, and recover from errors

###### Website 2: Oprah.com
https://www.oprah.com/index.html

Oprah's website is based off of her Network OWN also known as Oprah Winfrey Network. Originally she was a famous talk show host in the 1980s- 2000s and in the last decade, in 2011 she started her own TV Network. Oprah Winfrey is a long standing icon in the Black/African American community, journalism, talk shows, television, movies, plays, and in women's circles. the OWN website is a space for African American lifestyle and community with a primary focus on her network.

## 3: User Control and Freedom
![Oprah User control and freedom 1](https://github.com/wesleybleu/DH150-WESLEYC/blob/main/Oprah_usercontrol1.png)
![Oprah User control and freedom 2](https://github.com/wesleybleu/DH150-WESLEYC/blob/main/Oprah_usercontrol2.png)

- the OWN website is wokring to promote voting. However when going from the welcome page to the voting page, the user gets encompassed in voting central with no clear "emergency exit" button for the user to retreat from the voting information. This can cause conflict, especially since OWN is primarily an entertainment source.

## 4: Consistency and standards

![Oprah Consistency and Standards2](https://github.com/wesleybleu/DH150-WESLEYC/blob/main/O_consistency:Standards2.png)

-This site is a bit inconsistent in the ways that it is repetitive. The system is also not explicit when looking a the shows. Meaning that the user may think they do not have to sign up or create an account in order to participate. It is when the user keeps digging deeper, do they then realize that there is no longer access. This represents a kind of window shopping experience, although people may be looking to buy.

![Oprah minimalism 5](https://github.com/wesleybleu/DH150-WESLEYC/blob/main/O_minimalist5.png)

- This interface is an information overlaod, there is not really a simple entry. If someone is a first time user, they may be confused about what the site offers. These frames are crunched into tight parameters. A suggestion would be to create more space for the user to separately view the various shows and let them explore the possibilty of single frames. A lot of these shows have an abundance of frames of the website and it becomes repetitive. 


## 9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

## 10: Help and documentation
![Oprah Help and Documentation](https://github.com/wesleybleu/DH150-WESLEYC/blob/main/O_help%20and%20documentation.png)

- Although Oprah's site provides a site map to help users navigate, it is busy and a bit confusing. The map is pretty plain and is an organization of blocks with labels. A more productive strategy may be to label things by date, or category, or even supply an archive for information. As a new user of the site, I was slightly misguided looking at this layout.
